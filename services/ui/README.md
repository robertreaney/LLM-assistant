2. `aws_s3.py`: This file will contain the `AWSS3` class. This class will have methods for uploading and downloading files from AWS S3.

3. `audio.py`: This file will contain the `Audio` class. This class will have methods for recording and playing back audio.

4. `index.html`: This will be the main HTML file for our web application. It will contain the user interface for recording and playing back audio.

5. `main.js`: This will be the main JavaScript file for our web application. It will contain the logic for interacting with the user interface and making requests to the backend.

6. `style.css`: This will be the main CSS file for our web application. It will contain the styles for our user interface.
